### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a 31 year old Electronic Engineer from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and I'm studying to become a **Full Stack Developer** at **Rocketseat School**. I'm currently looking for opportunities. I love to learn and contribute in any and every possible way. I'm passionate about technology, people, theater and specially movies, as well as you've been noticed, I'm a huge fan of Star Wars.
